# My History of Aaron:

- Savanna Sulivian was an excellent coach, and I had the opportunity to participate in a first practice interview back in June 2024. Throughout the summer, I focused on Computer Science, and I visited on Thursday. As I began researching computer development, I carefully considered my choices regarding software and hardware, ensuring that I selected my classes thoughtfully and without feeling rushed. 

- During the fall and winter, I took a psychology class in the Fall semester of 2024, and I decided to retake it to deepen my understanding. During the winter and spring of 2025, I took a computer science course focused on C++. It was quite a challenging experience, especially with the assignments and documentation that needed to be completed on time. I appreciate the professor's support in clarifying concepts and providing feedback on my coding efforts, which has been invaluable.

- In the spring semester of 2025, I also enrolled in a creative writing course, which I found to be enjoyable. We met via Zoom on Monday mornings, where I had the opportunity to explore writing drafts for poetry, drama, and fiction. I had discussions with the instructors regarding my writing, ensuring I focused on original content without relying on outside sources that would require citations. 

- During the summer of 2025, I took a Java course where I diligently followed the GitHub assignments and project updates to maintain code accuracy, even utilizing an AI tool for assistance. I valued the opportunities to discuss GitHub issues with my professor over Zoom. Although I faced some challenges running JavaFX and creating GUI diagrams while preparing my JavaDoc, I recognized that acquiring a virtual Windows machine would be more effective than using Chromebooks.
